## Quote on Hiking  
> "It’s not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves." – Sir Edmund Hillary  

## Inline Code  
When planning a hike, you can calculate the **total distance** covered using the formula  
`total_distance = steps * step_length`.  

For example, if you take `10,000` steps with an average `step_length` of `0.8 meters`, the total distance covered is  
`10,000 * 0.8 = 8,000 meters (or 8 km)`.
